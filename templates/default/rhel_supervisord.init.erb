# Author:       Mike McGrath <mmcgrath@redhat.com> (based off yumupdatesd)
#               Jason Koppe <jkoppe@indeed.com> adjusted to read sysconfig,
#                   use supervisord tools to start/stop, conditionally wait
#                   for child processes to shutdown, and startup later
#               Additional changes were made by others after being
#               incorporated into the Opscode supervisor cookbook as
#               an erb template.
